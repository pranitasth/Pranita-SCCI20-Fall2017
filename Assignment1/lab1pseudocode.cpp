// This lab is about calculating the acceleration with the help of velocity, time, and distance.


//inputs
Create a struct for acceleration. The objet is a jet fighter. It's attributes are distance, time, speed, aceleration,and meters.
Have an input for distance, speed, time
Have a speed of jet fighter in km/hr
Have a distance of takeoff speed in m/s^2


//conversions
the acceleration should be in meter/s^2
the distance should be in km/hr.

//calculations
time = (7.2*(distance)/ speed);
acceleration = (speed /(meters * 3.6))

//outputs
It will show  the acceleration of  a jet fighter launched from an aircraft-carrier catapult at km/hr.
It will show the distance of the jetâ€™s takeoff speed at m/s^2.
